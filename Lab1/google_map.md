## Making a Custom Google Map Style
<p>Google maps has become somewhat ubiquitous in the last decade. The shere amount of up-to-date information has made it a tool that makes me laugh when I think about the old days of printing out directions from MapQuest before going on a trip. However, something about Google maps that most people do not know is that you can customize the look and feel of the maps for use in projects, websites, and presentations.</p>
<p>I had used the website <a href="https://snazzymaps.com/">Snazzy Maps</a> in the past and was aware of the number of customization elements one could alter. In the past I only used this feature to get clean line-based maps for presentations and had never thought about how to go about altering text color, outlines, and how the colors might interact at different levels of zoom (when you get really close, the street color is the most prominent, but when pulled back, land color is dominant.</p>
<p><img style="float: right;" src="https://mrfochs.github.io/Portfolio/Lab1/MapPalette.PNG" alt="Korean Temple Door" width="500" height="849" />As I have been longing to take another trip and stretch my "photography muscles," I went back into my photo archive and pulled out a few of my favorite images from past trips. The colorful nature of a temple door from my trip to South Korea jumped out as both bright and cheery, but also something that could become quite garish as a map if not toned down a bit. The Canva palette tool only gives five colors and did not include a hue of the deep red that I loved in the image. As a result, I threw the image into Photoshop, grabbed the ink dropped tool, and picked a sixth color (yeah, yeah, I know it's cheating). Mocking up the new palette, I got this final set of colors as inspiration for my map:</p>
<p>Looking at the image as if it were a map, I came to decide that the turquoise would have to serve as the blue traditionally associated with water. Building off from that, I felt that the creams and oranges of the palette mad sense as land elements. That left the dark brown, gray, and red colors for elements. Gray seemed like a logical choice for roads and taking a tip from the Canva tool skipping red, I decided to make it a small accent and assigned it to the controlled access highways of the map. The Dark brown was so rich in color, it did not work for any large element and I decided to use if as the font color for all layers of the map with a 50% saturation of the light tan as a "halo" around the text for better contrast and readability.</p>
<p>For the final image, I wanted to get a screen capture of the map style in Korea where the temple is located, but found out that for some reason, Google Map Style won't work on the Korean Peninsula (see image below). Instead, I decided to grab a screenshot of Pittsburgh as it gave a good collection of the different colors without too much of the bright water color to distract from the overall image. In general, I thnk there is still too much yellow/orange for the image to tie directly to the image, but when I tried to use the gray or other medium colors, it became very difficult to read.</p>
