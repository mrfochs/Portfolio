## Making a Custom Google Map Style

Google maps has become somewhat ubiquitous in the last decade. The shere amount of up-to-date information has made it a tool that makes me laugh when I think about the old days of printing out directions from MapQuest before going on a trip. However, something about Google maps that most people do not know is that you can customize the look and feel of the maps for use in projects, websites, and presentations.
To start my efforts of a suctom map style, I chose an image I took on a trip to South Korea a few years back. The primary colors of this temple door seemed like a good point palette to start my aesthetic design. Using the free, <a href="https://www.canva.com/colors/color-palette-generator/" target="_blank">online palette maker from Canva</a> I was able to come up with some major colors to build my styel from (see palette image below).
