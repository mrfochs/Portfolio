### Introduction
<p>Shortly after the first death to COVID-19 was recorded in the United States, fear started to spread regarding access to personal protective equipment (PPE). By the middle of March, 2020, news reports of hospitals and healthcare facilities reusing masks to reduce demand became common. With most of the equipment being made in China (which had been closed for two weeks for the Lunar New Year’s Celebration and then remained closed due to the spreading virus), the world’s supply chains were being disrupted with no back-up plan in place. Across the globe members of the maker community began testing methods of producing DIY PPE to support local needs.</p>

The informal group that calls itself “the tinkerers version of a bowling club” has members from across Allegheny County and typically communicates through an online Discord Server. On March 18, 2020 three members of the group including myself created a new channel (discussion thread) called “COVID Response.” Within 24 hours nearly 30 members had started to talk about ideas that the group could work on. By that Friday, March 20, an request had come in via a member’s wife to produce a small 3D printed part to allow nurses to open doors without touching the handle. Over the next few days, the group leaders’ contacts with a number of national 3D printing groups resulted in a full fledged response request with multiple orders for face shields, door helpers, and “ear savers” (used to move the elastic of face masks off the back of the user’s ears).</p>
<p>The quick evolution from discussion to requests for parts resulted in rapid decisions that were far from ideal for long-term project management and record keeping. However, as orders and requests have slowed down, I went to the two other leaders and asked if it would be helpful to audit the data (a single, public spreadsheet in Google Drive, a map of volunteers locations put together in ZeeMaps, and a “#Logistics” channel within the Discord group) and find a better way to continue tracking orders and production while also visualizing the great work the group had completed to date.</p>

### The Results
<p>About halfway through the project, the group got word from a number of our partners that no additional requests for PPE would be coming as large-scale manufacturing had begun injection molding and mass production of face shields and other needed parts. This was great to hear, but also meant that dedicating time to the initial goal of producing an intake system for future orders, volunteers, and production was not likely needed. However, the group had raised over $18,000 through a <a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/3dppgh-critical-3d-printed-ppe-for-medical-staff?utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=customer&utm_campaign=p_lico+share-sheet" target="_blank">GoFundMe page</a>, and it was decided that a full audit of the group’s efforts should be done to be as transparent as possible with our donors. The existing recording efforts were not to a standard that we felt appropriate to share with anyone. As such, the project became a full data audit and clean up to not only share with donors, but use as a public facing promotion of the groups efforts with future partners. A single source of data tracking for orders and volunteer production was created in CSV format and used to produce both embeddable graphics via the online tool, Kepler.gl, and a synced workbook in ArcGIS Insights that both visualizes production flow and tallies all efforts between March 20 – May 1, 2020. Additional efforts are ongoing to audit and track all donations (money, materials, delivery service, etc) in a similar manner.</p>
