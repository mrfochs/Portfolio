## Making a Custom Map Style ArcGIS Vector Tile Style Editor
I have found that having a well throughtout base map really makes it easy to get started with a GIS project. In ArcGIS Pro there are 12 base maps to choose from yet I almost always us the standard Light Grey option. This is because I feel it is the least intrusive to adding a design style and look to a map. Knowing that I have a number of mapping projects to work on before the semester ends, I took the time to investigate two different ways to try and build my own base map style.

### Using an Image to Inspire a Specific Look

With a number of my upcoming mapping projects being tied to the world's response to the COVID-19 outbreak, I decided to pull some inspiration from a picutre I took on a trip to the local Target a week before things started to get really bad here in the states. I put the image into Adobe's Color Tool and moved the selectors around to develop a stark but varrying palette of five colors. Knowing that I was using this inspiration for mapping, I was happy to see that Adobe's palette generator identified the small green patch in the top left from a Bounty paper towl role in the next isle. This ensured that I would have a green color to use for land/parks while the other colors were fairly muted and would work to develop a nice, neutral base map. One thing I told myself would be interesting is to use the dar red from the shadows of the red shopping cart for the roads since all people were told to stay in doors and not travel. Anytime someone were to use a road, they were essentially risking the spread of the vorus and therefore roads were a negative part of the map compared to staying indoors (which I thought to shade white impliying pureity and cleanliness).

After some tweaks, I came to a breakdown of the palette that I liked and felt was balanced. I then began to test different zoom levels. When pulled out to the scale of countries, I wanted there to be almost no detail on the map as any COVID data on that scale would likely be very busy and it would be about global reach - not its ties to cities, states, or even countries. At a medium/general distance I wanted to be able to see metropolitan/urban areas but not much else as again the virus data would likely be pretty wide spread and any drawn in barriers or boundries would be distracting. Lastly at the street level, I wanted to make sure that parks and buildings would be seen but not too visually distracting. It was at this level that I also wanted the red streets to be present
