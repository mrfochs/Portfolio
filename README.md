<p>Welcome to the public, online portfolio of data vizualizations and maps created by Matthew Fochs</p>

# About Me
<p>I am a designer by education, knowledge and learning manager by demand, but a photographer by heart. Reaching far beyond my childhood dream of “being a street performer,” I received a B.S. in Architectural Design from UW-Milwaukee’s School of Architecture and Urban Planning (’05). After spending the better part of the last decade using the excuse “I have a degree in drawing lines; not words,” I decided it was time to go back to school for a degree related to the non-profit management work I have pretended to understand since the ’09 banking crisis gave me an extended “vacation” from career I had dreamed of since getting my first set of Lego.</p>
<p>When I am not losing arguments with people in the comment sections of online newspapers, I can usually be found losing at board games to my fiancee, Cristine, or losing at tug-of-war to my crazy dog, Sir Argos Fuzzbutt the Third (Argos for short).</p>
<p>If you want to know more, have an unhealthy need for reading snarking political commentary, or love being inundated with pictures of cute dogs, you can follow me on <a href="https://www.twitter.com/mrfochs?lang-en" target="_blank">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/mrfochs/" target="_blank">Instagram</a>. <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/3zjDWuRpvKBpBrjs8" target="_blank">You can also see a random assortment of my photography and product design work here</a>.</p>

# What I Hope to Learn
<p>For the better part of my life I have focused on creating "pretty" things - whether it was buildings, websites, photographs, or the occasional watercolor painting. When it comes to sharing data or visualizing a complex problem, I tend to spend too much time on the visuals and lose site of the underlying context trying to be understood/told. I hope to combine the design with the data to make thins both interesting to look at, but also helpful to better understand complex information through maps, graphics, and other vizual data formats.</p>
