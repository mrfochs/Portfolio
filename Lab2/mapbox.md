## Making a Custom Map Style in Map Box and Bringing it into ArcMap
<img style="float:right; padding:5px;" src="https://live.staticflickr.com/4054/5157988485_6e474d60d8_c.jpg" width="35%" />Similar to my attempt to make a map style in <a href="https://mrfochs.github.io/Portfolio/Lab1/google_map" tagret="_blank">Google Maps Style Editor</a>, I wanted to see what I could come up with using Map Box's custom style editor. Specifically, I wanted to see if I could make a generic, primarly based map style that reminded me a little of the flat graphical stylings of airplane safety cards (the laminated things no one ever reads when the flight attendants tell you to). I had always be in love with the flat, shaddowless cartoon drawings and admired how they convey a lot fo information with little to no words.

### The Process and Testing in ArcMap
After some tweaks, I came to a breakdown of the palette that I liked and felt was balanced. I then began to test different levels levels of zoom. When pulled out to the scale of counties, I wanted there to be almost no detail on the map as any COVID data on that scale would likely be very busy already and it would be about global reach, not its ties to cities, states, or even countries. At a medium.general distance i wanted to be abkle to see metropolitan/urban areas but not much else as again the virus data would likely be pretty wide spread and any drawn in barriers or boundries would be distracting. Lastly at the street level, I wanted to make sure that parks and buildings would be seen but not too visually distracting. It was at this level that I also wanted the red streets to be present
